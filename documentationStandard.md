# Main Heading

Sandbox API Documentation Standardized. More warm and friendly description of what this portion of the program does.

More technical and specific description of what this part of the program does.

<a id='constructor'></a>
## Constructor

### new constructor(arguments)

Brief description of constructor.

**Arguments:**

`name` (`type`)(optional)  
Brief insight into argument. If the argument is optional add that in parentheses at the end.

*(None)*  
If there are no arguments explicitly state and italicize. In such a case there is no need for a description.

<a id='properties'></a>
## Properties

<a id=''></a>
### property1

Type: `type`

Brief description goes here.

<a id=''></a>
### propertyTwo

Type: `number`

Be as specific as possible on the type.  Include ranges or other limitations if possible. And still be brief.

<a id='methods'></a>
##Methods

<a id=''></a>
###method(arguments)

Brief description of method.

**Arguments:**

`name` (`type`)  
Brief description of argument. (I have also found it useful to add two spaces at the end of the name and type row, or else the description stays on the same line.  I don't understand why, but it does seem to work.) Or if there are no arguments:

*(None)*

**Returns:**

`name` (`type`)  
Brief description of returned value. Or if there is no returned value:

*(Nothing)*
