### /Support/Server/
The server files for the NodeJS application

### /support/client/proxy/
The VWF uses this location to store object definition files for the common object types. Here you'll find many of the YAML files for root object types like node3.vwf.yaml and scene.vwf.yaml. A few of these have been extended in Sandbox.

### /public/adl/Sandbox
This is the root directory of the client side application. Here is the index.vwf.yaml that defines the scene, and object definitions that are specific to the Sandbox, like Prim.vwf.yaml and Asset.vwf.yaml. There are also some default textures and assets that are part of the system, like the texture for the home grid. Resources that are used in the examples live here as well. 

### /public/adl/Sandbox/examples
This directory holds all the example scenes you find when you access the /examples/ page. Each example directory must start with 'example_'. 

### /public/adl/Sandbox/skys
The skyboxes. Notice how each is names with the BK,UP,DN,FR,RT or FL suffix. 

### /public/adl/Sandbox/textures
Not to be confused with the textures that are available through the API and are stored with the data

### /public/adl/Sandbox/terrain
Just some example assets

### /data
This is where all the data that is specific to a given install lives (by default. Can be overridden by the config file) See [Data Organization](Data Organization)

### /support/client/lib
This is where libraries required by the client side application live. Most of the system lives under /vwf/

### /support/client/lib/vwf/
The VWF system, and the associated boot files. The application is bootstrapped from here, and most of the client side app is in these subfolders

### /support/client/lib/vwf/views
This is where all the vwf view code lives. Many of the Sandbox features are implemented as vwf views. 

### /support/client/lib/vwf/views/EditorView
This is location of all the editor interface elements, as well as a few other bits of logic. The Editorview is responsible for creating all the widgets you normally see on the screen.

### /support/client/lib/vwf/models
The VWF model drivers. All the services that are provided to a running application are implemented as model drivers.

### /support/client/lib/vwf/models/threejs
The threejs model driver contains a lot of functionality, and is modularized into subdrivers. Files in this directory are loaded as required to provide threejs related services.
