The Sandbox is composed of two major components - the server side and the client application. 

## Server Side
The Sandbox server is a Node.js application that makes heavy use of Express. It's composed of several sub systems:

1. Reflector
1. File Server
1. Service API
1. Data Access Layer
1. Views

Session is currently handled with Express middleware, although this was not always the case. We are currently using Cookie-Session from (https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session).

### Reflector
The reflector is a portion of the system that synchronizes worlds. It's job is to accept messages from clients and send them to all participants in the world. This allows the simulation to only move forward when all clients receive the message. This system also keeps track of all the running worlds, and detects when all uses have left so a world can be shut down. See [VWF](VWF) for more information. This the system is implemented in **reflector.js**. See [File Organization](File Organization) for more info.

### File Server
The file server is a simple tool that responds to request for files by the client. Each file is GZipped and loaded into memory before being served. The File Server component is implemented in **filecache.js**. See [File Organization](File Organization) for more info.

### Services API
The web front end uses many services on the server to manipulate worlds and users. This system includes the endpoints for CRUD operations on worlds and users, as well as upload of files, thumbnails, and a few other odds and ends. The Express routes send any request that includes `/vwfdatamanager.svc/` to this system. It's implemented in **sandboxAPI.js**. See [File Organization](File Organization) for more info.

### Data Access Layer
The DAL interacts with the database to perform CRUD operation as requested by the Services API. It does not do any validation or verification, as it assumes that the front end has handled this. It does wrap several asyncronous steps into simple calls. It handles all storage. Currently, we write blobs to the filesystem and store metadata about worlds, users, and inventory in NeDB (https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb). See [Database](Database). The actual database interaction is implemented in **DB_nedb.js**. You can replace this to access a different DB. See [File Organization](File Organization) for more info. 

### Views
We use Hogan and Mustache to template the view files. These render all the front end GUI like the login page, the home page, and all the create/delete world logic.

## Client Application
Most of the client side application is wrapped up in the VWF application architecture. So, each feature is implemented as either a view driver or a models driver, depending on whether or not it provides services that can be accessed by the runtime reasoning of the world. See [VWF Overview](VWF Overview).

### Model Drivers
These modules actually affect the state of the running simulation. Together, they completely define the state of the world, and storing all their data represents a snapshot of the environment. 

**ThreeJS**
The ThreeJS model driver loads all asset files, and is one of the more complex parts of the system. Its responsible for interpreting information from the VWF nodes and creating the graphic representation. The current implementation is itself modular, with bits of functionality implemented in subdrivers that mirror the same VWF API. See [ThreeJS Model Driver](ThreeJS Model Driver).

**AmmoJS**
This is the physics driver. It is responsible for reading simulation state data and applying collision detection and Newtonian motion. See [AmmoJS Model Driver](AmmoJS Model Driver).

**JQueryUI**
The actual driver does very little. Most GUI code is in the views. See [JQueryUI Model Driver](JQueryUI Model Driver).

**javascript**
This driver does the actual execution of the code attached to VWF nodes through scripts. See [JavaScript Model Driver](JavaScript Model Driver).

**object**
Part of the core VWF, last chance data storage for object property data.

### View Drivers
View drivers do all the work in the system that is not available to applications. These modules may only interact with the application state by sending messages to the reflector. The internal state of these modules is not considered part of the replicated application data.

**JQueryUI**
This driver created JQueryUI objects to track the changing state of UI VWF nodes, and hooks up all the UI functionality so the nodes properly represent the UI state.

**EditorView**
This is the main entrypoint for the entire suite of editing tools. See [EditorView Driver](EditorView Driver)

**Audio**
This driver wraps up the Buzz audio library. (http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/). It responds to method calls on nodes and creates sounds.

**ThreeJS**
This is the graphics engine view component. It does the actual render, and is responsible for non-stateful UI bits like selection rectangles, highlights, and camera previews. See [ThreeJS View Driver](ThreeJS View Driver).

**xapi**
This module creates the interaction with the ExperienceAPI (http://www.adlnet.gov/tla/experience-api/).

**webRTC**
Provides the hookups for the Video chat function.
