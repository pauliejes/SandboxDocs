# Script Editor

![](http://i.imgur.com/Q7vXG9s.png)

The Script Editor it the only GUI interface that lets you directly write code. This code is injected into the VWF as either a new method or event for the selected object. See [Scripting Guide](../../Scripting/scripting/ScriptingIntro). 

This editor has 3 tabs - methods, events, and properties. 

The editor uses js_beautify on all input code before displaying it. Note that on some systems, the JS engine may insert "use strict". This is not a problem. 

This Editor allows the user to directly manipulate property values, which may be dangerous.
