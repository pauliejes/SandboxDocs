# Creating Cameras

There are two major things to understand about cameras in the VWF. First, the camera you are looking through by default in the Editor is a special camera that is not shared with other users. Each user has his or her own viewpoint when editing that is not shared between users. There is a function for temporarily broadcasting the position of your camera to other users; see the [Camera Modes](camera-modes.md "Camera Modes") section for more information. 

Second, you can also create camera objects within the scene. These cameras are full VWF entities, and can be scripted, copied, or deleted. They can even have behaviors applied, just as any other object. 

To create a camera, use the drop down menu. Choose `Create` > `Camera` > `Perspective`. The camera will be created at the center of your view. If you move your viewpoint within about 10 meters of the camera, and you are in a selection mode, you will see an icon appear to show you the location of the new camera object. If you do not see this icon, you may be too far away. That's OK, you can select the camera by name on the Hierarchy panel. 

When you have a camera selected in the editor, you will see a preview of the selected camera's view. This view will update in real time as you use the editor tools to move around the camera. You will also see in the main view a helper graphic to show you where the camera is pointing. This helper may show a camera viewpoint that is slightly behind the camera's position. This is normal. We actually use the near clip plane of the camera as the cameras 'position'. 

If you see the camera icon, you can double click it to activate the selected camera as the main camera. You can also activate different cameras by choosing `Camera` > `Activate Camera` from the drop down menu. Note: All the existing camera modes, such as 'Fly', or 'Orbit', apply only to the default Editor Camera. Selecting one of these modes will active the default camera.

When a camera is selected, you may edit some of it's properties in the Properties panel.

`Field of View` - The width of the camera view. A good default is 60, but you can simulate a telescopic view with a much smaller number.

`Near` - the near clip plane. Objects nearer than this will not be shown. Clip planes are used primarily to focus the depth buffer resolution around the area of interest in a scene. A full discussion of this topic is out of scope for this article. Just please note that you may see some visual artifacts if the near is set too low, or the far too high.

`Far` - the far clip plane. Objects farther than this will not be shown.
