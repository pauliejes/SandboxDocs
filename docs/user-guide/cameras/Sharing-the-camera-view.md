# Sharing the Camera View

Sometimes, it may be useful to allow other users to see the same view that you see, even if you are in the default editor camera. Normally, the editor camera is independent, and not replicated by the system to other users. This allow each user to work in a different part of the scene. 

When you share your camera view, other users will have their editor camera updated to see exactly the view you see. 

To share your camera view, use the drop down menu. Choose `Cameras` > `Share Camera View`. Click OK at the prompt. Each user in the world will be asked if they would like to receive the camera view, and also must accept. 

To disable the camera sharing, click the same menu item (`Cameras` > `Share Camera View`) again. Click OK at the prompt. 

!!! note:
	Both users must activate the default camera. Other cameras are always synchronized.
