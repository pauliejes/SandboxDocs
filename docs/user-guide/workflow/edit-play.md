# Edit and Play

When you're in edit mode, you see all the usual GUI tools in the interface, and can interact with the world. This is the default mode for a world - when you create one, you'll be in this state.

Edit mode has a few special features - you can pause and play the entire simulation with the buttons in the bottom left of the screen. Clicking Play will cause the simulation to execute, and stop will cause it to reset. When the world is 'playing', the GUI is disabled. This gives you a quick way to test behaviors or interactivity. 

While in Edit mode, the server will keep backups of the world every few minutes.
