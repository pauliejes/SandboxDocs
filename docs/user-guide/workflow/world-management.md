# World Management

You can manage a simulated world you create by going to the landing page for the world.  The landing page contains the Launch button.

In addition to the Launch button, are other world management buttons.  World management options include restoring past versions, deleting the world, duplicating it, and embedding it as an IFrame on other websites.
