# About VW Sandbox

The Virtual World Sandbox is an application based on the [Virtual World Framework](https://github.com/virtual-world-framework/vwf) with multiplayer simulation and collaborative authoring capabilities. The whole application runs in native Javascript, so no plugins or installs are required. You can visit our demo site at [https://sandbox.adlnet.gov](https://sandbox.adlnet.gov/100/adl/sandbox/ "VW Sandbox").

The VW Sandbox attempts to bring interactive simulation authoring to the Web. Using the latest browser technologies, we let you create, edit and share interactive experiences without the need to send executable files across email, or to ask your users to download or install anything. We call these experiences “Worlds” but they could be used as simulations, courseware, interactive training, or games.

## Virtual World Framework

The Sandbox project is based on, and an outgrowth of, the [Virtual World Framework (VWF).](https://virtual.wf/ "Learn more about the Virtual World Framework") The VWF is an architecture for building collaborative web applications - any application based on the framework allows naturally for multiple users to interact in real-time.

## Open Source

Both the Sandbox and the VWF teams recognize the important role community plays in developing software - we’re nothing without you! A novel arrangement with our government partners allows us to develop our systems for the public good. That means that this software is free to use, free to modify, and open for comment. Please see us on GitHub - we welcome pull request, bug reports, or collaboration. Visit the [Sandbox on GitHub](https://github.com/adlnet/Sandbox "Sandbox on GitHub") to request features, and file bugs.
