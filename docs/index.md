The VW Sandbox provides collaborative authoring and a multiplayer simulation engine written entirely in JavaScript.  It runs in a web browser with no plugins, which means there is no client installation required!  

The engine is entirely [open source](http://github.com/adlnet/Sandbox) using a permissive [Apache2 license](https://github.com/adlnet/Sandbox/blob/master/LICENSE).  We promote open content licensing using Creative Commons for Government created assets.

We are a small team supporting the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative and we're passionate about creating and using cloud-based simulations without the hassle of installation.
