<h1>VW Sandbox</h1>

Create and Deploy Simulations and Games Freely!

The VW Sandbox provides collaborative authoring and a multiplayer simulation engine written entirely in JavaScript.  It runs in a web browser with no plugins, which means there is no client installation required!  

The engine is entirely [open source](http://github.com/adlnet/Sandbox) using a permissive Apache2 license.  We promote open content licensing using Creative Commons for Government created assets.

We are a small team of software engineers supporting the Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative and we're passionate about cloud-based simulations without the hassle of installation.
