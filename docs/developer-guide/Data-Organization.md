# Data Organization

This page describes the layout of data in the data directory created by the DAL. For files of the application itself, see [File Organization](File-Organization). 

```
  /data
     /DataFiles
        /Models
        /Textures
        /Sounds
     /Logs
     /Profiles
     /States
     /Textures
     /Thumbnails
```

### /data/Datafiles
All files and sub-folders from here are simply served by the file server as `vwfdatamanager.svc/datafile/...` where `...` is the path to the file. You can place anything here you need for your own servers scenes, like models or textures

### /data/Logs
This folder will fill over time with log traces from the server and from each running world.

### /data/Profiles
Each user will have a folder here, and inventory asset blobs will be saved in it. Actual user profiles are stored in the DB, not as filesystem blobs.

### /data/States
Each world will have a folder here, named with the UUID of the world. The `state` file in this folder is the current JSON for the world. You can manually edit the world data in this file, if you choose. Each backup is stored here as well. Note that if you move the database or create or delete these files manually, you may have references in the DB to binary data that is not on the disk.

### /data/Textures
This subdirectory will be served to the client as part of the 'Map Browser' component. All files and directories will be indexed and downloadable. Files in this directory are assumed to be images.

### /data/Thumbnails
This directory should mirror the Textures directory, with the same files and the same folders. However, each file in this directory should be a thumbnail of its pair in the /textures/ directory.
