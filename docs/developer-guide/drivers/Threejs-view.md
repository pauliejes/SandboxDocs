# Three.js View Driver

The THREE.js View Driver manages all the rendering of the scene. It also includes the code for dealing with user input events and sending them over the VWF socket. 

This component is also responsible for displaying the inset selected camera view, and for rendering the object selection lines.

This driver is responsible for manipulating the graphics engine objects. Much of the actual functionality has been moved into the subdrivers, but some remains for historical reasons.
