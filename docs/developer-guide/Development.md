# Development

On Thursday of each week at around noon Eastern Standard Time (EST), a release candidate branch will be made from development and a meeting will be held to review the release candidate branch.

If the release candidate looks good post-meeting, then the release candidate branch will be merged into master.  A release number will be determined based on the type of changes (cf. http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), then the master branch will be tagged with the release number, release notes will be made, and the ADL hosted instance will be updated with the release.
