With the Sandbox, you can upload 3D asset file from your own computer into a world. This article explains how.

### Supported Formats:
1. 3DS
1. OBJ
1. FBX
1. DAE
1. OSG

Asset files that are uploaded to the Sandbox are not actually stored on the Sandbox server. Instead, they are indexed and tracked by the [ADL 3D Repository](https://3dr.adlnet.gov). This service converts and hosts the model and texture files. 

First, you'll need to create a .Zip file with the 3D model and all its texture. Make sure that you include all the textures that the model requires.

Choose **Create->Upload a 3D model** from the main menu. You should see something like this:

Either drag and drop your file, or click 'Browse'. Once you've selected a file, the upload button will enable. Be sure to give the object a title.

Click upload, and wait. If the upload is successful and conversion works, the model should appear in the scene.
