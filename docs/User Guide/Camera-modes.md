NOTE: The current camera controls assume you have a standard three button mouse.
NOTE: These camera controls apply to the default editor camera only. Selecting one will activate the default camera.

###  Orbit Camera (Camera->Orbit)
Orbit mode allows you to rotate the camera around a fixed point in space. This is useful to examine an object from many angles, and is the default camera mode. When in this mode, click the right mouse button and drag within the 3D view to rotate. Push your middle mouse button (or mouse wheel) and drag to pan the view. This will move the center of rotation around the scene. Roll the mouse wheel to zoom in or out from the center.

###  First Person Camera (Camera->First Person)
The first person camera mode will orient the camera behind your avatar. When in this mode, the mouse will not affect the camera placement. You may move your avatar with the arrow keys or the W, A, S, D, Z, and C keys. The camera will follow accordingly.

###  Navigate Camera (Camera-> Navigate)
The Navigate camera mode is complex, but also powerful. It's best used to navigate around a large region of space. The right mouse button functions as it does in Orbit mode, rotating around a fixed point in space. The name 'Navigate' comes from the method of moving this center. Push down with the middle mouse button (or mouse wheel) and pull the camera toward the bottom of the screen. This will move the camera such that the point you clicked stays under the mouse pointer. If you click a point off on the horizon, pulling down will move you closer to that point. Likewise, you can click a point at your feet with the middle button, and push it toward the horizon. This moves you quickly back away from that point. Additionally, you can middle click a point and roll the mouse wheel. This moves the center of rotation to that exact point in space, and zooms into a fixed distance from that point. You can use this method to quickly frame a given point in space, even if that point is not the center of an object. If you simply want to focus on an object, you should select that object and use the 'Focus' button. This will center you and place the camera in Orbit mode.

###  Free Camera (Camera-> Free)
The free camera mode allows a sort of first person perspective, but not attached to your avatar. Click and drag with the left mouse button to turn the view. Use the mouse wheel to move forward or back. Push the middle button and drag to pan the view.

###  Focus (Camera->Focus Selected)
Move the camera such that it frames the selected object in the view. This will reset the camera mode to 'Orbit'.

### Fly(Camera->Fly)
The camera will move forward at a set speed. Right click and drag to turn, and roll the mouse wheel to change speed.
