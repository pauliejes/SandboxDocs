Common mesh importation is done form the ADL 3D Repository however, the online sit Dropbox is also an excellent place to store and retrieve COLLADA models and textures.


NOTE: there are a few ways to import meshes. The 3DR integration service is the easiest and best way to import models, but it is also possible to supply a URL to a COLLADA file. The server that hosts the file must implement CORS, and have no authentication requirements. 

NOTE: Also, when directly adding a file URL, you are at the mercy of the importers and exporters - our system is completely bypassed.
