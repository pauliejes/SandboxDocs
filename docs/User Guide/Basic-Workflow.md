The Sandbox supports 2 main modes of operation - play and edit. 

### Editing
When you're in edit mode, you see all the usual GUI tools in the interface, and can interact with the world. This is the default mode for a world - when you create one, you'll be in this state.

Edit mode has a few special features - you can pause and play the entire simulation with the buttons in the bottom left of the screen. Clicking Play will cause the simulation to execute, and stop will cause it to reset. When the world is 'playing', the GUI is disabled. This gives you a quick way to test behaviors or interactivity. 

While in Edit mode, the server will keep backups of the world every few minutes.

### Playing 
When you are happy with the world (or game, or simulation....), you can 'publish' it. Publishing the world allows you some special options, like whether or not the system should generate avatars for each user, what camera the users should be assigned, and whether or not the users can see the editing tools.

Published worlds do not get saved - when the last user logs out, the world resets to the state it was in when it was published. 

Published worlds can be set to 'Single Player'. This means that when a user logs in, they are actually in a private copy of the simulation. This copy is not connected to the server - it neither saves its state, nor sends messages to the server about interactions. In some cases, this can result in significantly better performance for the end user, because server round trim latency is eliminated. 

### Testing

While in Edit mode, you should have an option on the file menu called "Test World" and one called "World Settings". In "World Settings", you have the same options as are available on the Publish page. Fill these out as you would when publishing the world. You can use the "Test World" command to get a real time view of exactly how the published world will behave. This feature will create a clone of your world on the server, set the publish settings, and launch it in a child window. The main window will be disabled. When the child window closes, the temporary world is delete off the server, and the main window is re-enabled. 

Usually, the play/pause feature of the editor should be enough to test, but you can use the above workflow to test aspects of your scene that play/pause cannot simulate - for instance, you might want to test code that responds to a users log in.

### Workflow
So, you'll go through these steps to create and share a world.

1. Create your world
1. Edit the world
1. Test the world
1. Publish the world
